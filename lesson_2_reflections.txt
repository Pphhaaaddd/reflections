Initialize using git init and check up using git git status

do this before start coding probably and must make it a habit of doing it everytime?

staging area : get started with the work with moving in small steps.

one logical change per commit suits well

when to branch? Experimental changes, new random ideas etc.

Diagrams? visualize the reachability, easy context

Merging? Automerge requires special care, manual can be tedious but safe
