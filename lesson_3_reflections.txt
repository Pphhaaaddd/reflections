reflections for lesson 3

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
-> Forks are github thing, bascially copying someone else's repo into your github
used when improving someone else work/editing
->clones are copying a repo in other contexts
pulling down one's work to work it on some other systems
->branches are some other work, like a commit branch
changes to code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state
of the remote stored locally?
work offline, then push it when online


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
->email/phycally talk/coordinate.
->git/github would be easier most of the time, also less time
