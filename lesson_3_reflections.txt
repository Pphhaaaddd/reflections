reflections for lesson 3

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
-> Forks are github thing, bascially copying someone else's repo into your github
used when improving someone else work/editing
->clones are copying a repo in other contexts
pulling down one's work to work it on some other systems
->branches are some other work, like a commit branch
changes to code
